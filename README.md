# authenz-go Go

This is a work in progress. Eventually it will be a configurable authentication and authorization framework for a microservices system where you can just put it into your ecosystem and not have to worry about writing your own auth(n)(z) system.

### Highlights
Uses JWTs for the authentication
Uses claims on the JWT for high level authorization
Enables multiple authentication strategies including:
 - Username and password
 - Google
 - Twitter
 - Github
 - Facebook
